Your TodoServiceTest.java file now includes all the more advanced JUnit test scenarios:

Verifying no interaction (never())
Capturing arguments with ArgumentCaptor
Conditional logic (if (isCompleted))
Filtering logic using stream().filter(...
Combined exception + side-effect testing 

These test cases will strongly reflect your backend and testing skills in an interview. Let me know if you want to:
Add REST endpoints with Spring Boot
Use an in-memory repository (like a fake DB)
Add integration tests with @SpringBootTest
